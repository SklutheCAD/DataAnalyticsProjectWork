# TSA Passenger Complaint Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes passenger complaint data from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to explore patterns in traveler feedback across airports and over time. The goal is to identify trends in complaint volume and contextual factors that may contribute to recurring operational concerns, and to demonstrate how public-sector analytics can support service improvement and decision-making.

## Business Problem
Public-facing agencies such as the TSA must balance security effectiveness, operational efficiency, and customer experience. Passenger complaints serve as a structured feedback mechanism that can reveal recurring friction points within screening operations and airport processes.

Understanding which complaint categories generate the highest volume — and how those patterns shift over time — can provide valuable insight for operational evaluation, training priorities, and process refinement.

This project seeks to explore those factors using publicly available TSA complaint data.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes complaint-level and aggregated information such as:

- Complaint date (year-month format)
- Airport
- Complaint category
- Complaint subcategory
- Complaint count
- Geographic region and country indicators

The data has been cleaned and structured for analysis, including date standardization, aggregation of complaint counts, and validation of categorical groupings.

## Methods
Analytical steps in this project included:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify complaint trends
- Time-series aggregation of monthly complaint totals
- Visualization of complaint patterns by category and airport
- Evaluation of dominant complaint drivers
- Interpretation of category versus subcategory structure

---

## Current Status
At this stage, the project has completed:

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Time-series aggregation
- Exploratory analysis
- Visualization development
- Interpretation of findings

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes
This project is included in the portfolio to demonstrate structured public-sector data analysis and applied analytical workflow. The analysis focuses on identifying trends and operational insights using reproducible methods and clear visual communication.
