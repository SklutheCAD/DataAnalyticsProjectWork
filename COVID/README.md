# COVID-19 Impact Analysis

This repository contains data, analysis code, and presentation materials used to examine national COVID-19 trends using official Statistics Canada data. The purpose of this project is to analyze case patterns, public health impacts, and temporal trends during the COVID-19 pandemic while clearly communicating findings through reproducible data analysis.

## About the Data

The dataset used in this project comes from Statistics Canada and contains national-level COVID-19 data including case counts, reporting timelines, and related public health indicators.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the original dataset is too large to upload directly to this repository.

You can download the official dataset here:

https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/13-26-0003/2020001/COVID19-eng.zip

After downloading:

1. Extract the ZIP file  
2. Place the relevant data files inside the `COVID19/Data/` folder  
3. Keep file names unchanged to ensure the analysis scripts run correctly

## Project Objective

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Examine trends in COVID-19 case activity over time  
- Identify surge and decline periods  
- Explore how patterns evolved throughout the pandemic  
- Present findings using clear visual storytelling and reproducible methods  

This project focuses on understanding data trends rather than predicting future outbreaks.
