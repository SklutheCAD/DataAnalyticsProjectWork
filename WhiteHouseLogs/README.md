# White House Visitor Log Analysis

This repository contains data, analysis code, and presentation materials used to examine patterns in White House visitor logs. The purpose of this project is to analyze visit and meeting trends over time and to clearly communicate findings using reproducible data analysis.

## How to Run This Project

Follow the steps below to reproduce the analysis.

### 1. Download the Repository
- Click Data and open the files 
- Extract the folder to your local machine
- Keep the folder structure unchanged

---

### 2. Review and Download Data Files
- Open the `WHITEHOUSE/Data/` folder
- Due to GitHub file size limitations, the visitor log data is split into **one CSV file per year**
- All yearly files share the same structure
- Do not rename or move these files, as the Python scripts use relative paths

---

### 3. Run the Python Analysis Script
- Open Python or a Jupyter Notebook environment
- Navigate to the `WHITEHOUSE/CodeFiles/` folder
- Open the main Python script (for example, `whitehouseLog.ipynb`)
- Run the script from top to bottom

The script performs:
- Data loading and year-level file combination
- Data cleaning and validation
- Exploratory and trend analysis
- Generation of summary outputs and visualizations

---

### 4. Compare Results with the Presentation
- Open the `WHITEHOUSE/Presentation/` folder
- Review the presentation slides
- Compare the analysis results generated by the Python script with the findings shown in the presentation

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher recommended
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
- Required Python packages are listed at the top of the script

---

## Notes
- Data files are separated by year to comply with GitHub storage limitations
- Each row represents a logged visit record, not necessarily a unique meeting
- This project is intended for academic and analytical purposes
- All analysis is reproducible using the provided data and code
