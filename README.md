# Sam Kluthe – Data Analytics Portfolio

## About Me
I am a data analytics student with a strong interest in applying data-driven insights to real-world business and policy problems. My background includes hands-on experience with Python, Power BI, and data visualization, with a focus on transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights for decision-makers.

My work often centers on applied analytics projects, including sports performance analysis, public policy and social impact data, and exploratory data analysis. I enjoy working through the full analytics process — from data cleaning and preparation to visualization and interpretation — with an emphasis on communicating results in a way that is accessible to non-technical audiences.

I am particularly interested in roles where analytics supports strategic decision-making, operational improvements, or performance evaluation.
