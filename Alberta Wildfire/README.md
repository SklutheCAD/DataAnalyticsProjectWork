# Alberta Wildfire Status & Burn Rate Analysis

This repository contains data, Python analysis, and presentation materials used to examine the development of wildfire status and burn rates in the province of Alberta.  
The project focuses on identifying patterns and trends in wildfire activity using historical data, with outputs designed for both analytical and non-technical review.

---

## Project Overview

This project examines:
- Changes in wildfire status over time
- Trends in wildfire burn rates
- Historical wildfire patterns across Alberta

The analysis was completed in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.  
A cleaned dataset was also created to allow users to easily explore the data in Excel without running code.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- Excel (optional, for data inspection)
