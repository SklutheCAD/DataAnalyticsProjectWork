# About Me

Hi, I’m Sam.

By day (and often late at night), I’m a data analyst and problem solver. By morning and weekend? I’m a hobby farmer.

## Life on the Farm

I run a small hobby farm where early mornings don’t start with emails — they start with animals. Caring for birds, managing feed, maintaining coops and fencing, and adapting to weather conditions has taught me something powerful:

Systems matter.

Farming is real-world operations management. You monitor inputs, track outputs, adjust processes, and respond to unexpected variables. Sound familiar? That’s data science in boots.

On the farm, I’ve learned:

- Consistency beats intensity.
- Small inefficiencies compound over time.
- Observation is everything.
- You solve problems with what you have.

That mindset directly influences how I approach analytics.

## Coding & Analytics

I specialize in turning messy datasets into structured insight.

Whether I’m analyzing sports performance, public-sector complaint data, or consumer behavior trends, my approach stays the same:

- Define the business problem clearly  
- Clean and structure the data carefully  
- Visualize patterns before modeling  
- Communicate findings simply  

I work primarily with:

- Python  
- pandas  
- matplotlib / seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Power BI  

I enjoy building end-to-end projects — from raw data ingestion to final presentation — with a focus on clarity, reproducibility, and storytelling.

## Why Both Matter

Farming keeps me grounded. Coding keeps me curious.

One teaches patience and adaptability.
The other demands precision and structure.

Together, they shape how I think: practical, analytical, and solution-focused.
