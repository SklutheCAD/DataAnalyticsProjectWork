# Edmonton Oilers Performance Analysis (In Progress)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes game-level performance data for the Edmonton Oilers to explore
patterns in team performance across a season. The goal is to identify trends and
contextual factors that may contribute to wins and losses, and to demonstrate how
sports analytics can support strategic decision-making in professional hockey.


## Business Problem
Professional sports organizations rely heavily on data to evaluate performance, guide
coaching decisions, and allocate resources effectively. For an NHL team such as the
Edmonton Oilers, understanding which factors most strongly influence game outcomes
can provide valuable insights for coaching strategy, scheduling considerations, and
performance evaluation.

This project seeks to explore those factors using historical game data.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes game-level information such as:
- Game date and location (home/away)
- Opponent
- Goals for and goals against
- Game outcome (win/loss/OT)
- Conference and divisional context

The data has been cleaned and structured for analysis, but additional feature
engineering is planned.

## Methods (Planned / In Progress)
Planned analytical steps include:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify performance trends
- Visualization of win/loss patterns by opponent and conference
- Evaluation of contextual factors such as home vs. away games
- Development of a predictive model to estimate win probability

## Current Status
At this stage, the project has completed:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Initial exploratory analysis
- Preliminary visualizations

Upcoming work includes:
- Additional feature engineering
- Model development and evaluation
- Interpretation of results and recommendations

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes
This project is included in the portfolio to demonstrate the analytical process and
workflow, even when an analysis is still evolving. Final results and conclusions will
be added as the project progresses.
