## How to Run This Project

### 1) Download the Repository
- Click **Code → Download ZIP**
- Extract the folder to your local machine
- Keep the folder structure unchanged

### 2) Review and Download Data Files
- Open the `KIA/Data/` folder
- All CSV files required for the analysis are located here
- Do not rename or move these files, as the code uses relative paths

### 3) Run the R Analysis Script
- Open R or RStudio
- Navigate to `KIA/CodeFiles/`
- Open `Kia_Thefts.R` (or `Kia_Thefts.Rmd`)
- Run the script from top to bottom

The script performs:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory and trend analysis
- Generation of outputs and visualizations

### 4) Compare Results with the Presentation
- Open the `KIA/Presentation/` folder
- Review the slides/PDF
- Compare outputs from the analysis with the findings presented

---

## Requirements
- R (4.0+ recommended)
- RStudio (optional but recommended)
- Required R packages are listed at the top of the scripts

---

## Notes
- This project is intended for academic and analytical purposes.
- Visualizations in the presentation are derived from the R analysis.
