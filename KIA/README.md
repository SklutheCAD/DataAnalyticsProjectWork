## How to Run This Project

Follow the steps below to reproduce the analysis.

### 1. Download the Repository
- Click **Code → Download ZIP**
- Extract the folder to your local machine
- Keep the folder structure unchanged

---

### 2. Review and Download Data Files
- Open the `KIA/Data/` folder
- All CSV files required for the analysis are located here
- Do not rename or move these files, as the R script uses relative paths

---

### 3. Run the R Analysis Script
- Open R or RStudio
- Navigate to the `KIA/CodeFiles/` folder
- Open the main R script (for example, `Kia_Thefts.R`)
- Run the script from top to bottom

The script performs:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory and trend analysis
- Generation of summary outputs and visualizations

---

### 4. Compare Results with the Presentation
- Open the `KIA/Presentation/` folder
- Review the presentation slides
- Compare the analysis results generated by the R script with the findings shown in the presentation

---

## Requirements

- R (version 4.0 or higher recommended)
- RStudio (optional but recommended)
- Required R packages are listed at the top of the R script

---

## Notes
- This project is intended for academic and analytical purposes
- All analysis is reproducible using the provided data and code
- Visualizations in the presentation are derived directly from the R analysis
